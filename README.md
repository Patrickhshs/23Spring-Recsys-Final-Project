●We propose a new model architecture SASRec4SV adapting SASRec for the short video
recommendation tasks with two implementations, one with linear prediction and the other
with the binary label.
● Secondly, we evaluate the performance of SASRec4SV on the practical dataset KuaiRand for
two user groups, namely what we define as normal users and influencers and show that our
model does exhibit popularity bias.
● Lastly, we intend to reproduce Watch Time Gain (WTG) [3]
to provide a fair evaluation that
alleviates video duration bias in short videos with different length. As the better standard to
reflect user’s preference and incorporate implicit feedback into our model, WTG could be
very helpful. Regrettably, due to time constraints, we were unable to apply the WTG fully.
